# The Gratit*you*de Project

During difficult times, it is easy to fall down a rabbit hole of tragic, devastating news every day of the week. As a result, one's perspective on the world may change into a darker, gloomier one: how do I move on when there is so much tragedy in the world? 

This project is meant to motivate users to take a step back everyday and ponder upon the good things in their lives. What made you smile? Who or what are you grateful for? What has been the silver lining of your day, regardless of how small that ray of light may be? 

Developed mainly using Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, this web application encourages users to write down a daily entry for 1 to 5 things they are grateful for in their lives. Following their entry, the user can then view their daily gratitude entries and remember all of the things in their lives they are thankful for, hence encouraging a more positive outlook on life. 

In addition, future versions of this application aim to present a timeline of positive, heartwarming news from the previous and current years on the home page to remind users that while there may be a lot of tragedy in the world, there is still much hope to be found.
